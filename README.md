## LodgeStats (Private Repository)

Live: https://stats.lodgegaming.com.tr

A live statistics and ranking platform directly connected to the bhop server timer database.

The system reads world record data from the same database used by the game servers and presents:

- Real-time recent records feed
- Map-based world records
- Top player rankings
- Style and track filtering (Main, Autostrafer, Segmented, etc.)
- Player performance metrics (jumps, strafes, sync, points)
- Active server monitoring (100 Tick / 128 Tick separation)

The website reflects authoritative in-game data, ensuring full consistency between server records and web rankings.

Core aspects:
- Direct database integration
- Ranking aggregation logic
- Real-time activity feed
- Multi-server synchronization
- Structured stat computation (points, sync %, performance metrics)
